# Roadmap
The order of individual tasks is a guide only and is subject to change depending on the situation.
Also, the later tasks are more indefinite and are subject to change as development progresses.

## (1)  Improve maintainability <current phase>

This is the phase we are at now. We need to make a high-maintenance environment that can withstand future development.

- Improve CI
  - Fix tests
  - Add more tests
- Improve documentation

## (2) Improve functionality

Once Phase 1 is complete and an environment conducive to the development of a stable system is in place, the implementation of new functions can begin gradually.
