# Contribution guide
We're glad you're interested in contributing valaxy-theme-sakura! In this document you will find the information you need to contribute to the project.

## Roadmap
See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)

## Issues
Before creating an issue, please check the following:

- To avoid duplication, please search for similar issues before creating a new issue.
- Do not use Issues to ask questions or troubleshooting.
  - Issues should only be used to feature requests, suggestions, and bug tracking.
  - Please ask questions or troubleshooting in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wrxinyue/valaxy-theme-sakura/discussions)

> **Warning**
> Do not close issues that are about to be resolved. It should remain open until a commit that actually resolves it is merged.

## Before implementation
When you want to add a feature or fix a bug, **first have the design and policy reviewed in an Issue** (if it is not there, please make one). Without this step, there is a high possibility that the PR will not be merged even if it is implemented.

At this point, you also need to clarify the goals of the PR you will create, and make sure that the other members of the team are aware of them.
PRs that do not have a clear set of do's and don'ts tend to be bloated and difficult to review.

Also, when you start implementation, assign yourself to the Issue (if you cannot do it yourself, ask another member to assign you). By expressing your intention to work the Issue, you can prevent conflicts in the work.

## Well-known branches

- **`master`** branch is tracking the latest release and used for production purposes.
